 * Get graphs working again (and write some tests)
 * Add a bit of JS to the transaction list
   * Click on a transaction row to select it (check box, highlight row), click again to de-select
   * Double-click a row to edit it (popdown div)
     * Maybe edit-in-place fields?
   * Move delete link to popdown div
 * Adding a new resource should happen in a facybox or something
 * Upon import, show a line in between current import and existing data (so we know what we've imported)
 
 * Figure out a way to screenscrape Regions' interface to automatically download CSVs
 
 * Can we style select boxes or file inputs?
 * Make integration stuff into a gem and require that instead (and convert over to spec/integration)
 * Add account management
 * Sort by column in transactions list
